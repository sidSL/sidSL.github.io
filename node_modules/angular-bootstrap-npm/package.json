  "readme": "#### update - Oct 10, 2015\n\n*This repo has been relocated to [jusopi/angular-bootstrap-npm](https://github.com/jusopi/angular-bootstrap-npm)*\n\n# angular-bootstrap-npm\n\nThis is a simple NPM package wrapper for http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap\n\n## usage\n\n**example**\n\n```javascript\nrequire( 'angular-bootstrap-npm' );\n\nangular.module( 'app', [ 'ui.bootstrap' ]);\n\n//you can also use the module as the module name, e.g.\n\nangular.module( 'app', [ require( 'angular-bootstrap-npm' )])\n```\n\n#### using the HTML template files\n\nThe default project file utilizes ui.bootstrap's build that includes the directive templates via `$templateCache`.  If for some reason you want direct access to the template HTML files, you can do the following:\n\n**example**\n\n```javascript\n//this file doesn't make use of angular's $templateCache\nrequire( 'angular-bootstrap-npm/dist/angular-bootstrap.js')\n```\n\n## building\n\nIn order to run the build process, you'll need to have npm, gulp installed globally.  Then install the project dependencies.\n\n**install npm dependecies**\n\n`npm install`\n\nWhile the intent is to maintain pairity with the various tags/versions found at https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap, you may want to build/modify your own version.\nIn order to build against a different version you can run the gulp build w/ a version argument: \n\n`gulp --ver=0.14.0`\n\nOne thing to note is that your command line may act unresponsive as the build process for ui.bootstrap is quite extensive.  Also it may open a browser window during testing.\n\n\n```\n\n## license\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Neohapsis Inc.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
